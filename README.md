#CanadaRox's TF2 Autoexec
##Info
This is my person autoexec for TF2.  It is a remake of the [tf2compconfiguration](http://code.google.com/p/tf2compconfiguration/) tweaked for my own needs.  My video settings are based on Chris's dx9frames FPS config with slightly better appearances.

The binds that are included are set up for my own personal taste on a *COLEMAK* keyboard and will not work on a regular keyboard! (ex my WASD keys are WARS)

##Important Note!
This config unbinds all of your keys and sets its own binds.  Backup your existing configs before you install it as Steam Cloud will remember all of the new binds.  If you screw up your config, I will laugh at your misfortune!

##How to install
Go to your TF2 folder (C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\steamapps\\*your Steam login name*\\team fortress 2\\tf\\cfg).  Copy all of the configuration files with the same directory structure into your cfg folder.

##Features
* Shift + number will change to the corresponding class
* F9-12 changes between class presents
* Per slot aliases for each class allowing for easy customization
* Null-cancelling movement script so you can be a 1337 scoot
* derpjump script that automatically crouches when you jump and stays crouched while you hold space (disabled for solly demo and eng for better jump control)
* L4D2 style "last\_inv" that switches to your primary weapon if you are on anything else, and your secondary if you are on your primary
* Viewmodels off for most non-melee weapons by default
* Tweaked crosshair per weapon and class (I generally like large crosshairs so most of them are pretty big)
* Useful per class scripts/tweaks
